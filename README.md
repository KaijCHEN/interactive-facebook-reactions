# interactive-facebook-reactions
Jupyter notebook + Code for processing Facebook Reactions data and making Interactive Charts


## Usage
The interactive charts are available in the `charts` folder. To view the interactive chart, download the chart HTML file and the `plotly` folder also present in the `charts` folder, and have both the HTML file and the `plotly` folder in the same directory. (alternatively, you can just download the entire repository).

The `scripts` folder contains two Python scripts: a modified version of my Facebook Page Post Scraper which can be accessed via the command line, and a quick web page scraper for Top Facebook Pages (via [Fan Page List](http://fanpagelist.com/category/top_users/view/list/sort/talking_about/))to get the Facebook Page IDs of the top pages.

The `data` folder contains CSVs of the relevant Facebook Posts from each page February 24th, 2016 onward, obtained using the scraper. Posts were retrieved between June 20-24th, 2016.
